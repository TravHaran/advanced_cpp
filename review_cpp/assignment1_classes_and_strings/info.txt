A simple C++ class represents a URL, such as "http://www.example.com/index.html"

The class has two members of type std::string. One member stores the protocol of the URL
(the "http" part) and the other stores its resource (the "www.example.com/index.html" part which comes after the separator).

Questions for this assignment
1. Define the class.
    write a constructor for the class which takes the protocol and resources as arguments
2. Add a member function to the class which displays the complete URL: the protocol, followed
    by the separator, followed by the resource. For example, "http://www.example.comindex.html"
3. Write a program to test your class. This program will create an object of the class then call its
    member function to display the complete URL.
